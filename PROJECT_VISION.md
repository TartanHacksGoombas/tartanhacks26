WinterWise

## Overview
WinterWise is a web app for everyday Pittsburghers to predict which roads will close during an upcoming snowstorm and plan routes around them.

## Core Features (Must-Have)
- **Road closure prediction**: ML model (with possible heuristic components) predicts closure of Pittsburgh roads during an upcoming snowstorm. Trained on historical road closure data.
- **Map view**: Interactive map showing which roads are at risk of closure
- **Route planning**: Google Maps-style origin/destination route planning that avoids predicted-closed roads. Integrates with an existing maps/routing API (specific API TBD).

## Technical Decisions
- **Platform**: Web app (frontend framework & backend language TBD)
- **Database**: TBD
- **Weather data source**: TBD
- **Maps/routing API**: TBD (candidates: Google Maps, Mapbox, OpenRouteService, Leaflet)
- **Road network data**: TBD

## Data
- Historical Pittsburgh road closure data: available (format & details TBD)
- Weather/snowstorm data: source TBD
- Scope: all Pittsburgh roads ideally

## Target Users
Everyday Pittsburgh commuters and residents
